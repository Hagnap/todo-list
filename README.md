## Challenges Faced
Personal Challenge: Use Semantic HTML
    * This wasn't something difficult, just different but in a good way. In the past I used divs for headers, footers, navbars, and other things that are HTML elements. So for this project I am forcing myself to not do that and to use the proper HTML elements instead (ex I will use `<header>` for headers and not `<div id="header">`)
