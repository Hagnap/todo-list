# todo-list

## Description
This project is a simple todo list. There are two ways to store data, tasks and projects. Tasks are things todo that are independent of eachother. Tasks have four elements; a name, description, due-date, and priory. Priority can be a value in the range of 1-3 where 1 is high priority and 3 is low priority. Projects store a collection of tasks that are related to eachother. Projects have two elements; a name and an array of tasks. To make sure the data is persistent LocalStorage was used, this was my first time using this API.

## Challenges Faced
Personal Challenge: Use Semantic HTML
    * This wasn't something difficult, just different but in a good way. In the past I used divs for headers, footers, navbars, and other things that are HTML elements. So for this project I am forcing myself to not do that and to use the proper HTML elements instead (ex I will use `<header>` for headers and not `<div id="header">`)
